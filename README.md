# Brent-oil-prices-data-analysis

# Task 1
Focuses on defining the data analysis workflow and understanding the model and data. 

1.	Defining the Data Analysis Workflow:
    - Clearly outline the steps and processes involved in analyzing the Brent oil prices data.
    - Ensure a comprehensive understanding of how the data is generated, sampled, and compiled.
    - Understand the model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
    - Identify and state any assumptions and limitations of the analysis.
    - Determine the main media channels and formats for communicating results to stakeholders.
    
2.	Understanding the Model and Data:
    - Read the main references related to the project to grasp the key concepts and models being used.
    - Familiarize with models suitable for time series analysis, such as ARIMA or GARCH, and how they relate to the Brent oil prices data.
    - Explain the purpose and application of these models in the context of analyzing price fluctuations.
    - Identify the processes that generate the data and how these are modeled by the chosen time series models.
    - Describe the expected outputs and limitations of the analysis, and how predictions are made.
