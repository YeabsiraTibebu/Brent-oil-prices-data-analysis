# Brent-oil-prices-data-analysis

# Task 1
Focuses on defining the data analysis workflow and understanding the model and data. 

1.	Defining the Data Analysis Workflow:
    - Clearly outline the steps and processes involved in analyzing the Brent oil prices data.
    - Ensure a comprehensive understanding of how the data is generated, sampled, and compiled.
    - Understand the model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
    - Identify and state any assumptions and limitations of the analysis.
    - Determine the main media channels and formats for communicating results to stakeholders.
    
2.	Understanding the Model and Data:
    - Read the main references related to the project to grasp the key concepts and models being used.
    - Familiarize with models suitable for time series analysis, such as ARIMA or GARCH, and how they relate to the Brent oil prices data.
    - Explain the purpose and application of these models in the context of analyzing price fluctuations.
    - Identify the processes that generate the data and how these are modeled by the chosen time series models.
    - Describe the expected outputs and limitations of the analysis, and how predictions are made.

# Task 2
1.	Adapt the Knowledge from Task 1.1 to Analyze Brent Oil Prices:
    - Build on the foundational understanding of time series analysis developed in Task 1.1.
    - Apply this knowledge to analyze the historical Brent oil prices data.
2.	Utilize Additional Statistical and Econometric Models as Needed to Refine the Analysis:
    - Explore advanced time series models such as VAR (Vector Autoregression) for multivariate time series analysis.
    - Consider regime-switching models like Markov-Switching ARIMA to capture different market conditions.
    - Implement machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for capturing complex patterns and dependencies in the data.
3.	Explore Other Potential Factors Influencing Oil Prices:
    - Economic Indicators:
        i.	GDP (Gross Domestic Product): Analyze the correlation between GDP growth rates of major economies and oil prices.
        ii.	Inflation Rates: Examine how inflation in key economies impacts oil demand and prices.
        iii.	Unemployment Rates: Investigate the relationship between unemployment rates and oil consumption patterns.
        iv.	Exchange Rates: Assess the effect of currency fluctuations, especially the USD, on oil prices.
    - Technological Changes:
        i.	Advancements in Extraction Technologies: Study the impact of technologies like hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and deep-sea drilling on oil supply.
        ii.	Renewable Energy Developments: Analyze how growth in renewable energy sources affects oil demand and prices.
        iii. Efficiency Improvements: Evaluate how improvements in fuel efficiency and alternative energy usage influence oil consumption.
    - Political and Regulatory Factors:
        i.	Environmental Regulations: Investigate how stricter environmental regulations and carbon pricing affect oil production and prices.
        ii.	Trade Policies: Study the impact of trade agreements, tariffs, and embargoes on oil markets.
